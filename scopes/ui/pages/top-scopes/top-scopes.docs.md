This component uses other components to make a complete page and show the most public scopes.  
This page uses hooks to get his data and use [Loader](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui/loaders/loader-ribbon) and [Error](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui/input/error) components from [base-ui](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui) to handle loading and error.
