## Overview

A standard React development environment for building modular and reusable MFEs.

### Usage instructions

Create a **variant** in project's `workspace.json` file.  
Set this extension as the variant's extension.

```json
{
   "teambit.workspace/variants": {
     "{ui/*}": {
       "harmony-mfe.scopes/envs/mfe-react": {}
     }
   }
}
```

### Theming
This environment adds the design theme [Theme](https://bit.dev/harmony-mfe/design/theme-context) tp all compositions of the components that use this example env.

### Data fetching
This environment configures the bit.dev API gateway for all compositions by default.
Gateway URL can be modified on the local workspace for development purposes.  
Set this configuration in `workspace.json` to set a different gateway URL:

```json
{
  "harmony-mfe.scopes/envs/mfe-react": {
    "symphonyGatewayUrl": "localhost:5000"
  },
}
```

### Compilation
By default, Component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. Target format is `ES2015` which
supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering.

### Testing
Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default `teambit.react/react`.
